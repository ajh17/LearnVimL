* make saving & executing the LVL_recipe results easier/possible

* start early eval.txt exercises as simple one-liners
* build up by giving function templates requiring learners to fill gaps
* work up to having learners write multiple functions with calling between them
* for more advanced sections, have:
** nearly working functions that require fixups
** problem statements requiring code solutions
** case-studies of "good" real-world code (taken from some of the great plugins)
